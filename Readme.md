**A modified index finger based grip**

* The original index finger based grip from **Nobuhiko Hasegawa** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuhiko_Hasegawa)

> Hasegawa was a famous exponent of heavy topspin forehand attack, combined with lob defence. He used a modified shakehands grip with the index finger pointing down the center of the blade. This made his backhand a little awkward for fast attack, so even though a shakehander his tactics were similar to the Japanese penholders with wonderful footwork.

> Hasegawa's grip style is mostly forehand focus, and his backhand technique is more focus on blocking, hitting and lobbing. I feel that this is due to historical reason where back in the 1960s and 1970s, Japanese players are mostly peholders and one of the main advantage of penhold is the forehand attack.

**A modified index finger based grip**

* The original index finger based grip from **Nobuhiko Hasegawa** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuhiko_Hasegawa)

> Hasegawa was a famous exponent of heavy topspin forehand attack, combined with lob defence. He used a modified shakehands grip with the index finger pointing down the center of the blade. This made his backhand a little awkward for fast attack, so even though a shakehander his tactics were similar to the Japanese penholders with wonderful footwork.

> Hasegawa's grip style is mostly forehand focus, and his backhand technique is more focus on blocking, hitting and lobbing. I feel that this is due to historical reason where back in the 1960s and 1970s, Japanese players are mostly peholders and one of the main advantage of penhold is the forehand attack. 

* The reverse backhand penhold grip from **wang hao** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Hao_(table_tennis,_born_1983)

> Wang Hao uses a penhold grip. He is representative of a new wave of penhold players, having good attacking and defensive skills off both wings of the table. The greater freedom of the wrist involved in a penhold grip allows Wang Hao to generate large amounts of spin on the forehand side.

* Combining Hasegawa's grip style and wang hao's grip style

> Inspired by Hasegawa and Wang Hao, I started taking an effort to create a modified index finger based grip (**MIFBG**) so that we we can combine the best part of shakehand grip and the penhold grip.
> In The MIFBG, we still have the index finger still pointing down the center of the blade but move about 1 inch further away from it. And we use the scaphoid bone and lunate bone to support the base of the paddle handle and we will wrap the middle finger, the ring finger and the little finger around the handle.

* MIFBG as a framework and possible plugins

**A modified index finger based grip**

* The original index finger based grip from **Nobuhiko Hasegawa** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuhiko_Hasegawa)

> Hasegawa was a famous exponent of heavy topspin forehand attack, combined with lob defence. He used a modified shakehands grip with the index finger pointing down the center of the blade. This made his backhand a little awkward for fast attack, so even though a shakehander his tactics were similar to the Japanese penholders with wonderful footwork.
